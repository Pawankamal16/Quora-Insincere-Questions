Quora is a common online forum where users can ask questions and (usually) receive thoughtful responses. Although the majority of questions are asked in good faith, a small percentage of bad actors ask questions that are either insincere or problematic (for example, questions based on false premises or questions that are simply intended to make a statement). In order to improve the overall group experience, a challenge is to create a classifier that will take a user-generated query asinput and automatically identify it as genuine or fake.
